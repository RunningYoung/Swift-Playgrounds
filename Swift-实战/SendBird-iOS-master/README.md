## Introduction

[SendBird](https://sendbird.com) provides the chat API and SDK for your app enabling real-time communication
among your users. SendBird Sample UI has three features for the chat and messaging.

1. **Open chat**: Open chat is a public chat. There is a channel which can be participated by anyone without an admission. The channel can be created on `SendBird` dashboard or via `server API`.

2. **1-on-1 messaging**: 1-on-1 messaging is a private channel between two users. Basically it is same as group messaging channel with only two members.

3. **Group messaging**: Group messaging is a private channel between multiple users. The user who wants to join the Group messaging channel has to be invited by other user who is already joined the Group messaging channel.
